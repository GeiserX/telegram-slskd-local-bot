# CLAUDE.md — telegram-slskd-local-bot

## Overview
Telegram bot that automates music discovery and download. Resolves track metadata from Spotify, searches and downloads FLAC files from Soulseek via slskd, renames them to `Artist - Title.flac`, and places them in a music library directory.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- python-telegram-bot (Telegram Bot API)
- spotipy (Spotify Web API, Client Credentials flow)
- slskd-api (Soulseek/slskd REST API)
- FastAPI + uvicorn (health check endpoint)
- mutagen (audio metadata)
- Docker (image: `drumsergio/telegram-slskd-local-bot`)
- Published on PyPI
- pytest + pytest-asyncio for testing
- uv for dependency management
- ruff for linting/formatting

## Development
```bash
# Install
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# Or with uv
uv sync

# Lint and format (always run before committing)
ruff check src/
ruff format src/

# Test
pytest
# Or with uv
uv run pytest
```

Configuration via `.env` (see `.env.example`).

## Architecture
- `src/music_downloader/` — main application package
  - `config.py` — all environment variables and their handling
  - `bot/handlers.py` — Telegram bot logic and conversation flow
  - `search/scorer.py` — search result scoring algorithm
- `scripts/` — utility scripts
- `tests/` — test suite
- `docker-compose.yml` — full stack deployment
- `Dockerfile` — container build
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — code quality hooks

## Scoring Algorithm

Search results are ranked by 4 factors (total 100 points):
1. **Duration match** (40 pts): Compared to Spotify reference duration
2. **Audio quality** (25 pts): Prefers 16-bit/44.1kHz CD quality
3. **Source reliability** (20 pts): Free slots, upload speed, queue
4. **Filename relevance** (15 pts): Artist/title word matching

Exclude keywords filter out live/remix/etc unless the original title contains them.

## Soulseek (slskd) Search Patterns

- **Single query, local filtering**: Never append format keywords (e.g. "flac") to the slskd search query -- Soulseek matches keywords against full file paths, which is unreliable. Instead, search with `artist title` and filter results locally by file extension (`.flac` preferred, fall back to other audio formats)
- **Search lifecycle**: `search_text()` -> poll `state()` -> `stop()` on timeout -> grab partial results from `search_responses()` -> `delete()` cleanup
- **Async wrapping**: All synchronous `slskd-api` calls must be wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the Telegram bot event loop
- **Timeouts**: Hard timeout via `asyncio.wait_for()` around the entire search+poll loop; `searches.stop()` actively cancels the server-side search on timeout

## Telegram UX Patterns

- **Markdown escaping**: Dynamic text (filenames, paths from Soulseek) must be escaped with `_escape_md()` or wrapped in backtick code spans to avoid `BadRequest` from Telegram's Markdown parser
- **Safe edits**: Always use the `_safe_edit()` wrapper (catches `BadRequest`, `TimedOut`, `NetworkError`) instead of raw `msg.edit_text()`
- **Result identification**: Download messages must include `#number` labels matching the result list so users can tell concurrent downloads apart
- **Spotify results cap**: Show max 5 results to the user; fetch 10 from the API for filtering headroom
- **Spotify artist filter**: When query contains `artist - title`, filter Spotify results by artist substring match before dedup to remove noise; fall back to unfiltered if the filter empties the list

## Deployment

### Release Steps

1. Commit to `main`, create a **new** semver tag (e.g. `git tag v0.3.1`), push with `--tags`
2. GHA `docker-publish.yml` builds and pushes `drumsergio/telegram-slskd-local-bot:<tag>` to Docker Hub
3. Update `gitea/watchtower/slskd-importer/docker-compose.yml` with the new tag, commit and push to Gitea
4. Redeploy via Portainer API on **watchtower** (stack ID `195`, endpoint `2`)
5. Verify with `docker ps --filter name=slskd_importer` on watchtower

### Versioning Rules

- **NEVER** force-retag an existing version. Each release gets a unique semver tag.
- **Patch** (`v0.3.0` -> `v0.3.1`): Bug fixes, UX tweaks, small changes
- **Minor** (`v0.3.x` -> `v0.4.0`): New features, significant behavior changes
- **Major** (`v0.x.y` -> `v1.0.0`): Breaking changes
- Check the latest tag before tagging: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
- Also update the image tag in `gitea/watchtower/slskd-importer/docker-compose.yml` to match

## External Dependencies

- **Spotify API**: Client Credentials flow (no user login). Used only for metadata resolution.
- **slskd API**: REST API with API key auth. Used for search, download, and file management.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Long-polling mode. Restricted to allowed user IDs via `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** Scorer, config parsing, file handler, TrackInfo
- **Integration:** slskd client, Spotify resolver (with mocks)
- **Coverage target:** 80%

## Key Rules
- Never hardcode API keys (Telegram, Spotify, slskd); use environment variables
- Allowed Telegram users must be explicitly configured
- Docker images use semver tags, never `:latest`
- License is GPL-3.0
- Follow PEP 8, use type hints, prefer f-strings
- Telegram bot: [@slskdimporterbot](https://t.me/slskdimporterbot)

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
